Website made in PHP for my WebDev2 project. The site connects to a database on phpmyadmin called "project". The database consists of tables storing user information, book information, reservations on books, and book genres. The website allows visitors to create an account and login. They are also able to view the book catalogue and search for books by Title, Author name, or genre. When logged in, users can reserve a book and then view all the books that they have reserved. Further, users can also choose to cancel a reservation that they have made on a book.
